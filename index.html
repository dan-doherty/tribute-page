            <h3 id="headline">Dr. Borlaug's War on Hunger:</h3>
            <p>Borlaug was often called "the father of the Green Revolution", and is credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation. According to Jan Douglas, executive assistant to the president of the World Food Prize Foundation,
                the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook's 1997 article "Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity." The article states that the "form of agriculture that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion deaths." He was awarded the Nobel Peace
                Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply.</p>
